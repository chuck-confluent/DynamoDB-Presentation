== The Relational Way

Suppose we want to query for all the usernames of users in a particular game.

[cols="2a,a,a",options=header]
|===
|Star Schema
|Pros
|Cons



|* Table for "user"
* Table for "game"
* Fact table that relates "user_ID" with "game_ID"
* Join "user" and "game" tables and filter for records with the given "game_ID"

|* Great for ad-hoc queries
* Great for analytics, like aggregations

|* Joins don't scale well

|===

<<<

== The DynamoDB Way

image::entities.png[]

NOTE: One table with O(1) lookup by primary key, or O(log(n)) if including a sort key. No joins! You _plan_ the access pattern into your data model and include everything in one table.

<<<

== Design the Primary Key

.Composite Primary Key
[cols=3*,options=header]
|===
|Entity	|Partition Key (a.k.a. HASH)	|Sort Key (a.k.a. RANGE)
|User	|`USER#<USERNAME>`	|`\#PLACEHOLDER#<USERNAME>`
|Game	|`GAME#<GAME_ID>`	|`\#PLACEHOLDER#<GAME_ID>`
|UserGameMapping	|`GAME#<GAME_ID>`	|`USER#<USERNAME>`
|===

<<<

== Code Example

Query multiple entities in one request to one table

[source,python]
----
resp = dynamodb.query(
        TableName='battle-royale',
        KeyConditionExpression="PK = :pk AND SK BETWEEN :placeholder AND :users",
        ExpressionAttributeValues={
            ":pk": { "S": "GAME#{}".format(game_id) },
            ":placeholder": { "S": "#PLACEHOLDER#{}".format(game_id) },
            ":users": { "S": "USER$" },
        },
        ScanIndexForward=True
    )
